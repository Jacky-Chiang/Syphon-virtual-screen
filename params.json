{"name":"Syphon virtual screen","tagline":"","body":"Add a fake extra-display to your mac and pipe its video content to use in your video workflow.\r\nThis can be used i.e. to hijack video output of applications that can go full-screen but are not (yet?) Syphon-enabled. \r\n\r\n# How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe package installer will install EWProxyFrameBuffer, that is a video driver for a fake display (in fact a RAM buffer). The client application (Syphon Virtual Screen) allows you to activate / deactivate the driver, choose the resolution, enable/disable the Syphon server. If you don't know what Syphon is yet, you should definitely [check it out](http://syphon.v002.info);\r\n\r\n# How does it perform?\r\n\r\nThe short answer is: fast enough to be used in production. \r\nBut since Syphon framework has been built from the ground up to give the best performance possibile it is worth saying that, since SVS is based on a CPU buffer memory, every frame has to be uploaded to the GPU RAM, which is a (relatively) slow operation. But still it works fairly fast depending on your needs.\r\n\r\n# How much does it cost?\r\n\r\nIt is free and [open source](https://github.com/andreacremaschi/Syphon-virtual-screen). If you use SVS in your performance or vj set or whatever else, please [let me know]().\r\n\r\nSVS is based on bangnoise/vade's [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info) framework and Enno Welber's [EWProxyFrameBuffer](https://github.com/mkernel/EWProxyFramebuffer) (thanks to all you guys!).\r\n\r\n[Download SVS now](https://github.com/andreacremaschi/Syphon-virtual-screen/releases/download/1.2.3/Syphon.Virtual.Screen.mpkg.zip)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
